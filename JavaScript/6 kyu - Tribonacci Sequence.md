# [Tribonacci Sequence](https://www.codewars.com/kata/tribonacci-sequence/train/javascript)

## Instuctions

  Well met with Fibonacci bigger brother, AKA Tribonacci.

  As the name may already reveal, it works basically like a Fibonacci, but summing the last 3 (instead of 2) numbers of the sequence to generate the next. And, worse part of it, regrettably I won't get to hear non-native Italian speakers trying to pronounce it :(

  So, if we are to start our Tribonacci sequence with [1, 1, 1] as a starting input (AKA signature), we have this sequence:

```
  [1, 1 ,1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31, ...]
```

  But what if we started with [0, 0, 1] as a signature? As starting with [0, 1] instead of [1, 1] basically shifts the common Fibonacci sequence by once place, you may be tempted to think that we would get the same sequence shifted by 2 places, but that is not the case and we would get:

```
  [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, ...]
```

  Well, you may have guessed it by now, but to be clear: you need to create a fibonacci function that given a signature array/list, returns the first n elements - signature included of the so seeded sequence.

  Signature will always contain 3 numbers; n will always be a non-negative number; if n == 0, then return an empty array and be ready for anything else which is not clearly specified ;)

  If you enjoyed this kata more advanced and generalized version of it can be found in the Xbonacci kata

## Solution

```
  function tribonacci(signature,n){
    var arr = [];
    var sum;
    if(n<3){
      arr = signature.splice(0,n);
      return arr;
    }else{
      arr = signature;
      if(n-3>0){
        for(var i=0; i<n-3; i++){
          var arrLen = arr.length;
          sum = arr[arr.length-1] + arr[arr.length-2] + arr[ arr.length-3];
          arr.push(sum);
        }
      }
      return arr;
    }
  }
```
